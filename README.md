## Summary

Thanks to this script, i was able to find out a lot of information about this Elections and got overall votes per county, the election winner and more. With some modifications, this script could be used for future elections. You could add a fucntion that shows what county voted for which candidate and find out the exact number. You could also modify this script to find out how many votes one of the loosing candidates could have needed to win the election. The script is very easy to follow and can be modified to do so much more for other type of information gathering.
